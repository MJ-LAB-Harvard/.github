# Projects at MJ Lab at Harvard

This collection is maintained by MJ Lab at Harvard.  
We focus on simulation modeling, systems science, and data-driven approaches to inform public health policy and decision-making.  
We emphasize open science, sharing code and data whenever possible to support transparency and collaboration.  
All project code and public datasets are organized in separate repositories.  
Feel free to reach out if we can help with the reproducibility of any of our analyses.  
Enjoy exploring!
